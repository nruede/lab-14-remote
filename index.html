<h1>The Mutants Are Revolting</h1>
<p>Bender?! You stole the atom. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I don't want to be rescued. I love you, buddy! Shinier than yours, meatbag.</p>
<h2>The 30% Iron Chef</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Kif might!</p>
<ul>
<li>I love you, buddy!</li>
<li>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</li>

<p>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? You lived before you met me?! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>

<li>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</li>
<li>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Obsoletely Fabulous</h5>
<p>Professor, make a woman out of me. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Anyone who laughs is a communist!</p>
